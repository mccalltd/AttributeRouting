Feature: Route Constraints

Scenario Outline: Inline constraints
	# MVC
	Given I have registered the routes for the InlineRouteConstraintsController
	When I fetch the routes for the InlineRouteConstraints controller's <actionName> action
	Then the route url is "Inline-Constraints/<actionName>/{x}"
	And the parameter "x" is constrained by an inline AttributeRouting.Web.Constraints.<constraintTypeName>
	# Web API
	Given I have registered the routes for the HttpInlineRouteConstraintsController
	When I fetch the routes for the HttpInlineRouteConstraints controller's <actionName> action
	Then the route url is "Http-Inline-Constraints/<actionName>/{x}"
	And the parameter "x" is constrained by an inline AttributeRouting.Web.Constraints.<constraintTypeName>
	Examples: 
	| actionName  | constraintTypeName       |
	| Alpha       | AlphaRouteConstraint     |

Scenario: Inline constraints in the querystring
	# MVC
	Given I have registered the routes for the InlineRouteConstraintsController
	When I fetch the routes for the InlineRouteConstraints controller's Querystring action
	Then the route url is "Inline-Constraints/Querystring"
	And the parameter "x" is constrained by an inline AttributeRouting.Web.Constraints.IntRouteConstraint
	And the parameter "y" is constrained by an inline AttributeRouting.Web.Constraints.QueryStringRouteConstraint
	# Web API - NOTE: this won't work until web api vNext
	#Given I have registered the routes for the HttpInlineRouteConstraintsController
	#When I fetch the routes for the HttpInlineRouteConstraints controller's Querystring action
	#Then the route url is "Http-Inline-Constraints/Querystring"
	#And the parameter "x" is constrained by an inline AttributeRouting.Web.Constraints.IntRouteConstraint
	#And the parameter "y" is constrained by an inline AttributeRouting.Web.Constraints.QueryStringRouteConstraint

Scenario: Multiple inline constraints per url segment
	# MVC
	Given I have registered the routes for the InlineRouteConstraintsController
	When I fetch the routes for the InlineRouteConstraints controller's MultipleWithinUrlSegment action
	Then the route url is "Inline-Constraints/avatar/{width}x{height}/{image}"
	And the parameter "width" is constrained by an inline AttributeRouting.Web.Constraints.IntRouteConstraint
	And the parameter "height" is constrained by an inline AttributeRouting.Web.Constraints.IntRouteConstraint
	# Web API
	Given I have registered the routes for the HttpInlineRouteConstraintsController
	When I fetch the routes for the HttpInlineRouteConstraints controller's MultipleWithinUrlSegment action
	Then the route url is "Http-Inline-Constraints/avatar/{width}x{height}/{image}"
	And the parameter "width" is constrained by an inline AttributeRouting.Web.Constraints.IntRouteConstraint
	And the parameter "height" is constrained by an inline AttributeRouting.Web.Constraints.IntRouteConstraint

Scenario: Inline constraints specified in the RoutePrefixAttribute
	# MVC
	Given I have registered the routes for the PrefixedInlineRouteConstraintsController
	When I fetch the routes for the PrefixedInlineRouteConstraints controller's Index action
	Then the route url is "Prefixed-Inline-Constraints/{id}/Howdy"
	And the parameter "id" is constrained by an inline AttributeRouting.Web.Constraints.IntRouteConstraint
	# Web API
	Given I have registered the routes for the HttpPrefixedInlineRouteConstraintsController
	When I fetch the routes for the HttpPrefixedInlineRouteConstraints controller's Index action
	Then the route url is "Http-Prefixed-Inline-Constraints/{id}/Howdy"
	And the parameter "id" is constrained by an inline AttributeRouting.Web.Constraints.IntRouteConstraint

Scenario: Inline constraints specified in the RouteAreaAttribute
	# MVC
	Given I have registered the routes for the AreaInlineRouteConstraintsController
	When I fetch the routes for the AreaInlineRouteConstraints controller's Index action
	Then the route url is "Area-Inline-Constraints/{id}/Howdy"
	And the parameter "id" is constrained by an inline AttributeRouting.Web.Constraints.IntRouteConstraint
	# Web API
	Given I have registered the routes for the HttpAreaInlineRouteConstraintsController
