Feature: Route Conventions

Background: 
	Given I generate the routes defined in the subject controllers

Scenario Outline: Generating routes using the RestfulRouteConvention
	When I fetch the routes for the RestfulRouteConvention controller's <action> action
	Then the route url is "<url>"
	 And the default for "controller" is "RestfulRouteConvention"
	 And the default for "action" is "<action>"
	 And the route for <action> is constrained to <method> requests

	Examples:
		| action	| method	| url									|
		| Index		| GET		| RestfulRouteConvention				|
		| New		| GET		| RestfulRouteConvention/New			|		
		| Create	| POST		| RestfulRouteConvention				|		
		| Show		| GET		| RestfulRouteConvention/{id}			|		
		| Edit		| GET		| RestfulRouteConvention/{id}/Edit		|		
		| Update	| PUT		| RestfulRouteConvention/{id}			|		
		| Delete	| GET		| RestfulRouteConvention/{id}/Delete	|		
		| Destroy	| DELETE	| RestfulRouteConvention/{id}			|		
		| Custom	| GET		| RestfulRouteConvention/Custom			|

Scenario Outline: Generating routes using the RestfulRouteConvention on controllers with a RoutePrefix attribute
	When I fetch the routes for the RestfulRouteConventionPrefix controller's <action> action
	Then the route url is "<url>"
	 And the default for "controller" is "RestfulRouteConventionPrefix"
	 And the default for "action" is "<action>"
	 And the route for <action> is constrained to <method> requests

	Examples:
		| action	| method	| url					|
		| Index		| GET		| Prefix				|
		| New		| GET		| Prefix/New			|		
		| Create	| POST		| Prefix				|		
		| Show		| GET		| Prefix/{id}			|		
		| Edit		| GET		| Prefix/{id}/Edit		|		
		| Update	| PUT		| Prefix/{id}			|		
		| Delete	| GET		| Prefix/{id}/Delete	|		
		| Destroy	| DELETE	| Prefix/{id}			|	
		
Scenario Outline: Generating routes using the DefaultHttpRouteConvention
	When I fetch the routes for the DefaultHttpRouteConvention controller's <action> action
	Then the route url is "<url>"
	 And the default for "controller" is "DefaultHttpRouteConvention"
	 And the default for "action" is "<action>"
	 And the route for <action> is constrained to <method> requests

	Examples:
		| action	| method	| url									|
		| GetAll    | GET		| DefaultHttpRouteConvention			|
		| Get		| GET		| DefaultHttpRouteConvention/{id}		|		
		| Post  	| POST		| DefaultHttpRouteConvention			|		
		| Put		| PUT		| DefaultHttpRouteConvention/{id}		|		
		| Delete	| DELETE	| DefaultHttpRouteConvention/{id}		|			
		| Custom	| GET		| DefaultHttpRouteConvention/Custom		|	
		
Scenario Outline: Generating routes using the DefaultHttpRouteConventionPrefix on controllers with a RoutePrefix attribute
	When I fetch the routes for the DefaultHttpRouteConventionPrefix controller's <action> action
	Then the route url is "<url>"
	 And the default for "controller" is "DefaultHttpRouteConventionPrefix"
	 And the default for "action" is "<action>"
	 And the route for <action> is constrained to <method> requests

	Examples:	
		| action	| method	| url				|
		| GetAll    | GET		| Prefix			|
		| Get		| GET		| Prefix/{id}		|		
		| Post  	| POST		| Prefix			|		
		| Put		| PUT		| Prefix/{id}		|		
		| Delete	| DELETE	| Prefix/{id}		|			
		| Custom	| GET		| Prefix/Custom		|						

Scenario: Generating routes using the RestfulRouteConvention on actions with an explicit route defined
	When I fetch the routes for the RestfulRouteConventionWithExplicitRoute controller's Index action
	Then the 1st route url is "RestfulRouteConventionWithExplicitRoute"
	 And the 2nd route url is "Legacy"

Scenario: Generating routes using the RestfulRouteConvention on actions with an explicit ordered route defined
	When I fetch the routes for the RestfulRouteConventionWithExplicitOrderedRoute controller's Index action
	Then the 1st route url is "RestfulRouteConventionWithExplicitOrderedRoute/Primary"
	 And the 2nd route url is "RestfulRouteConventionWithExplicitOrderedRoute"

Scenario: Generating routes using the DefaultHttpRouteConvention on actions with an explicit route defined
	When I fetch the routes for the DefaultHttpRouteConventionWithExplicitRoute controller's Get action
	Then the 1st route url is "DefaultHttpRouteConventionWithExplicitRoute"
	 And the 2nd route url is "Legacy"

Scenario: Generating routes using the DefaultHttpRouteConvention on actions with an explicit ordered route defined
	When I fetch the routes for the DefaultHttpRouteConventionWithExplicitOrderedRoute controller's Get action
	Then the 1st route url is "DefaultHttpRouteConventionWithExplicitOrderedRoute/Primary"
	 And the 2nd route url is "DefaultHttpRouteConventionWithExplicitOrderedRoute"
