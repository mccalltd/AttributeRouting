Feature: Route Constraints

Background: 
	Given I generate the routes defined in the subject controllers

Scenario: Regex route constraints specified with an attribute
	When I fetch the routes for the RouteConstraints controller's Index action
	And  I fetch the routes for the ApiRouteConstraints controller's Get action
	Then the parameter "p1" is constrained by the pattern "\d+"

Scenario: Regex route constraints specified inline
	When I fetch the routes for the RouteConstraints controller's InlineConstraints action
	And  I fetch the routes for the ApiRouteConstraints controller's InlineConstraints action
	Then the route url is "InlineConstraints/{number}/{word}/{alphanum}/{capture}"
	Then the parameter "number" is constrained by the pattern "\d+"
	Then the parameter "word" is constrained by the pattern "\w{2}"
	Then the parameter "alphanum" is constrained by the pattern "[A-Za-z0-9]*"
	Then the parameter "capture" is constrained by the pattern "(gotcha)"

Scenario: Multiple routes with different constraints
	When I fetch the routes for the RouteConstraints controller's MultipleRoutes action
	And  I fetch the routes for the ApiRouteConstraints controller's MultipleRoutes action
	Then the route named "MultipleConstraints1" has a constraint on "p1" of "\d+"
	 And the route named "MultipleConstraints2" has a constraint on "p1" of "\d{4}" 
	 And the route named "ApiMultipleConstraints1" has a constraint on "p1" of "\d+"
	 And the route named "ApiMultipleConstraints2" has a constraint on "p1" of "\d{4}"
